We then use beautifulsoup4 package, a Python module that helps to scrape information from the web pages to extract all the tables from this Wikipedia page and convert it into a pandas data frame. Then the data is cleaned by removing the unwanted cells and then we use Python\u2019s geopy package to obtain the latitude and longitude of all the neighbourhoods present in the data frame. The obtained coordinates are then merged with the main data frame with list comprehension operation. \n\nOnce the coordinates are obtained, we use Foursquare API to extract the venues using client credentials along with the version, radius and limit values and to cluster them based on preferences we use kmeans clustering. We also use folium map to display the clusters geographically.\n"
